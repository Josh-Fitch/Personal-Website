This page gives some insight into Joshua Fitch's life.

## Education

I am currently a Junior at Purdue University pursuing a Bachelors in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering (AAE). I hope to attend graduate school and would like to specialize in applications of small satellites to interplanetary exploration. Some of my specific research interests include swarm and formation flying spacecraft, advanced Guidance, Navigation, & Controls methods, and artifical intelligence applications to astronautics. 

## Hobbies

While Purdue AAE can be time consuming and stressful, I still try and make time for the things I enjoy. I am an avid reader of science fiction, and I am currently on the 7th book of the Expanse Series by James Corey. Some of my favorites include the Foundation Series by Isaac Asimov, The Martian by Andy Weir, Cosmos by Carl Sagan, and Chasing New Horizons by Alan Stern and David Grinspoon. 

Aside from reading, I love rock climbing (specifically bouldering), hiking, and running. Really anything that gets me active and outdoors. It can be a great way to take the mind off of the stress of school. 

## Dreams and Aspirations

As a child, I dreamed of becoming an Astronaut. While that dream still exists, it has been molded and transformed into a broader goal of contributing to the exploration of the universe and expanding humanities prescense in the solar system. While I would I still love to go into space one day, I see now how many different ways one can help humanity grow and learn more about the universe we live in. I would ideally like to work in the space industry, contributing to a company developing unique and exciting ways to develop space. In the long term, I would like to return to Academia and contribute to teaching the next generation of engineers and scientists along with developing novel research.
