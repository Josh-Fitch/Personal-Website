#### Space Flight Projects Laboratory | Aerodynamic Deorbit Experiment
##### August 2019 - Present

  * This semester I am working as an undergraduate researcher under Professor David Spencer, head of the [Space Flight Projects Laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SFPL). In this position I am assisting with the [Aerodynamic Deorbit Experiment]()https://engineering.purdue.edu/CubeSat/missions/ade, a mission demonstrating a deployable drag-sail device that could eventually be used to ensure satellites can de-orbit in an efficient time post-mission-success. 

  * My specific tasks for this position include writing Flight Software in C using Ubuntu. The Flight Software I am speifically generating includes Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data acquisition and communications protocol between various spacecraft components and the ground stations.

#### Dark Matters Research Lab | Data Analysis Undergraduate Researcher
##### August 2018 - January 2019

  * Over Fall 2018 Semester, I worked as an undergraduate researcher under Professor Rafael Lang, head of the [Dark Matters Lab](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/darkmatters/). In this position I assisted with data analysis from the [XENON Detector in Italy](https://science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/?cat=3). I worked with a group of 4 other undergraduates to develop python scripts in Jupyterlabs. These python scripts sorted, cleaned, and organized the data and then evaluated it for specific trends based on a variety of parameters that could be indicate dark matter collision events.
