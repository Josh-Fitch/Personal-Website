## Professional Experience

# NASA Ames Research Center | Satellite Systems Engineering Intern
June 2019 - August 2019

At Ames Research Center I worked as a systems engineer with the Advanced Composites Solar Sail System (ACS3) project team. I operated as an assistant to the Mission Systems Engineer, and completed tasks on a weekly as-needed basis. 

One of my primary tasks involved calculating orbital debris collision probabilities and verifying the results using NASAâ€™s Debris Assessment Software. As this analysis progressed and evolved, I created a technical presentation that verified ACS3 meets NASA Standard 8719.14A Process for Limiting Orbital Debris. 

Another major task was to evaluate potential problems with communication blockages from satellite appendages and the solar sail membrane. To address this issue, I modeled ACS3 in AGI STK (Systems Tool Kit) to determine the optimal patch antenna placement to minimize the issue and generate a corresponding link budget and time-in-view of ground station. This analysis was done using the AzEl Mask Tool to allow STK to interpret the satellite geometry when evaluating the ground track. 

Additional major tasks included drafting an Interface Control Document to define specifications and standards for interfaces between all electrical hardware and software components of spacecraft payload, generating and baselining Level 2 and Level 3 requirements, and evaluating the ACS3 mission against NASA Requirements Compliance Matrices. All of these tasks provided experience in topics ranging from space traffic management, trajectory planning, Radio Frequency communications, requirements generation, documentation, and presentation skills.

# NASA Johnson Space Center | Mission Design Software Engineering Intern
January 2019 - May 2019

At Johnson Space Center I worked in the Exploration Mission Planning Office developing BLAST (Beyond LEO Architecture Sizing Tool), a program used for spacecraft mass estimation for human-rated vehicles and mission architecture design. 

My work included programming in C++ and utilizing the Qt GUI library to fix and improve BLAST by diagnosing bugs, implementing new user input options, and fixing logical sizing issues. This included modeling potential solutions to logical issues with BLAST by creating a MATLAB script to randomly generate and systematically evaluate hundreds of possible user input combinations. 

After implementing these improvements, I utilized BLAST and Excel to conduct trade-space studies on potential 2024 Human Lunar Exploration architectures. I evaluated designs with varying propellant combinations, staging orbits, launch vehicles, and spacecraft designs. 

Finally, in this position I co-authored a paper with my mentor and other professionals in my office looking at the potential for a crewed mission to the dwarf planet Ceres. My task for this paper was to create a pork-chop plot in MATLAB evaluating the ideal launch window and associated characteristic orbital energy. 

This internship took me out of my comfort zone and forced me to learn a variety of new skills, including programming in multiple languages, spacecraft design, mission architecture design, trajectory analysis, and even presentation skills. Overall, I had the incredible opportunity to explore Johnson Space Center and meet Astronauts, Flight Directors, and Engineers while contributing to NASA's goal of pushing the boundaries of space exploration.

## Research Experience

# Space Flight Projects Laboratory | Aerodynamic Deorbit Experiment Undergraduate Researcher
August 2019 - Present

This semester I am working as an undergraduate researcher under Professor David Spencer, head of the [Space Flight Projects Laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/SFPL). In this position I am assisting with the [Aerodynamic Deorbit Experiment]()https://engineering.purdue.edu/CubeSat/missions/ade, a mission demonstrating a deployable drag-sail device that could eventually be used to ensure satellites can de-orbit in an efficient time post-mission-success. 

My specific tasks for this position include writing Flight Software in C using Ubuntu. The Flight Software I am speifically generating includes Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data acquisition and communications protocol between various spacecraft components and the ground stations. 

# Dark Matters Research Lab | Data Analysis Undergraduate Researcher
August 2018 - January 2019

Over Fall 2018 Semester, I worked as an undergraduate researcher under Professor Rafael Lang, head of the [Dark Matters Lab](https://www.physics.purdue.edu/darkmatters/). In this position I assisted with data analysis from the [XENON Detector in Italy](https://science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/?cat=3). I worked with a group of 4 other undergraduates to develop python scripts in Jupyterlabs. These python scripts sorted, cleaned, and organized the data and then evaluated it for specific trends based on a variety of parameters that could be indicate dark matter collision events.
